# Help us get there before time runs out. Donate to our emergency fund.

## Taking less time to arrive means more time to save lives.

The moment an emergency happens is the moment we have to act. We need you before this year ends to help us replenish our emergency relief fund so that we can be prepared at a moment’s notice in 2016. 

Thanks to people like you, we were able to provide life-saving care the day our help was needed to millions of people when the Ebola crisis hit last year. Your gift right now to our emergency relief fund ensures we can be there, whenever and wherever the next emergency occurs. We need your support - give now.

### Our impact.

From the recent Ebola outbreak, to supporting the millions of Syrian migrants, and helping victims from Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines and the Indian Ocean tsunami, our work has saved millions of lives. We implement our medical programs in areas where no health or sanitary systems exist, or where the current infrastructures have been overwhelmed by health needs.

> "We never know when disaster will strike, or when we need to react quickly to a changing situation. Knowing that there are funds available to make a rapid, effective plan to respond to an emergency is essential to MSF's work."
> Dr. AnnMarie Pegg, Head of Mission in Yemen.

### Long-term emergency response.

Often times, after immediate medical emergencies have passed, we adapt our programs to meet the long-term medical needs of the population no matter how long it takes. Lack of access to health care is an emergency for those needing it, and making the care accessible even months or years after a disaster is a major component of our emergency response.

## Accountable to you.

Over 90% of our funding comes from people like you, and your generosity allows us to act quickly, remain independent and go where the need is greatest. With 384 projects worldwide, we are the world’s leading independent international medical relief organization, implementing and managing medical projects across the globe. For more than 40 years, we have been providing medical assistance to people affected by armed conflicts, natural disasters, disease epidemics, malnutrition crises and other emergencies.  We are renowned for our ability to respond quickly and for our efficient work in complicated crises.  But we can’t do our work without you.
